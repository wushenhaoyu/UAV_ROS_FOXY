CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindCeres.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Ceres", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Ceres" with any of
  the following names:

    CeresConfig.cmake
    ceres-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Ceres" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Ceres_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Ceres"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
